## 1. About Unit-selection Speech Synthesis

Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech computer or speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech.

And for **Unit** **selection** **synthesis** is using large databases of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual phones, diphones, half-phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences.

## 2. Unit-selection Speech Synthesis

In Unit-selection Speech Synthesis, we use a large speech database which provides all syllable in. Like Japanese, Use those  pronunciation:

We need collect all pronounce of those words and record it. After that, we need add label for the $Initials$ and $finals$,than, do $prosodic\ parameter\ extraction$ and $spectral\ parameter\ extraction$. After that load into the Unit-selection Synthesis model which waiting for synthesis.

## The Unit-selection Speech Synthesis Algorithm

$$
\begin{aligned}
C^{c}\left(u_{i-1}, u_{i}\right) &=\sum_{k=1}^{q} w_{k}^{c} C_{k}^{c}\left(u_{i-1}, u_{i}\right) \\ 
C^{\prime}\left(t_{i}, u_{i}\right) &=\sum_{j=1}^{p} w_{j}^{\prime} C_{j}^{t}\left(t_{i}, u_{i}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\hat{u}_{1}^{n}=\arg \min _{u^{i}}\left\{C\left(t_{1}^{n}, u_{1}^{n}\right)\right\}
$$

$$
C\left(t_{1}^{n}, u_{1}^{n}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} C^{\prime}\left(t_{i}, u_{i}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{n} C^{c}\left(u_{i-1}, u_{i}\right)
$$

$$
C^{c}\left(u_{i-1}, u_{i}\right) : \text { Concatenation cost }
$$

$$
C^{t}\left(t_{i}, u_{i}\right) : \text { Target cost }
$$
